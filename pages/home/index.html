    <div id="underline"></div>
    <p class="lalign para">
      We work towards making cities sustainable by reducing the environmental
      impacts of cities. We believe that, through effective solid waste
      management and recycling we can achieve this goal. Burning of plastic
      waste is a common practice in India which degrades Urban air quality. Akri
      brings together both the street waste collectors and users together for
      effective disposal of recyclable solid waste.
